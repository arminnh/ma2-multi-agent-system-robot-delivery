\section{Problem definition}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Setting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pizzeria chain RoboPizza
        \item Pizza delivery using robots (AGVs)
        \item RoboPizza receives pizza delivery requests (tasks), robots deliver the pizzas
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Environment}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Grid city system
        \item AGVs can go in both directions on streets
        \item AGVs can pass each other

        \item Dynamism:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Road works cause streets to be closed off
        \end{itemize}

        \item Efficiency measure:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Total waiting time for tasks
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Robots}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can move from and to any position in the city
        \item Have static maps and can compute paths between locations
        \item Can carry up to 5 pizzas at once
        \item Can only communicate with entities that are close to them (i.e. city node they are on)
        \item Run on batteries which need to be recharged
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can charge at charging station
            \item Station supports limited amount of robots at once
        \end{itemize}

        \item Potential crash:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can run out of battery $\rightarrow$ reset battery after time delay as simulation of manual replacement
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Tasks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consist of picking up (multiple) pizzas and delivering them to a destination in the city
        \item If there are more than 5 pizzas in a task, it has to be split up
        \item Pizzas have no preparation time and can be picked up instantly
        \item Created each simulation tick with low probability that scales with city size:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Amount of pizzas by Gaussian distribution
                \item Delivery position uniformly random in city
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
