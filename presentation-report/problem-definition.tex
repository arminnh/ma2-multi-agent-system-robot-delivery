\section{Problem definition}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Setting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pizzeria chain RoboPizza
        \item Pizza delivery using robots (AGVs)
        \item RoboPizza receives pizza delivery requests (tasks), robots deliver the pizzas
        \item Manhattan style city blocks
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Robots}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can move from and to any location in the city
        \item Have maps and can compute paths between locations
        \item Can carry up to 5 pizzas at once
        \item Can only communicate with entities that are close to them
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - Tasks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consist of picking up (multiple) pizzas and delivering them to a location before a certain timepoint
        \item If there are more than 5 pizzas in a task, it will have to be split up
        \item Will be created every time step with low probability:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Delivery time window based on distance from pizzeria + randomness
                \item Amount of pizzas from Gaussian distribution
                \item Delivery location uniformly random in city
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem definition - World}
    Dynamism
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Streets can become closed off due to road works
        \item Amount of pizerrias
    \end{itemize}

    Potential AGV crashes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Running out of battery
        \item ?
    \end{itemize}

    Efficiency measure
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total waiting time for task
    \end{itemize}

    Charging
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Happens on one location.
        \item Charging station can only serve a limited amount of robots.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
