    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different parameter settings for each hypothesis
        \item Each experiment is run 50 times
        \item Experiment end statistics are written to files
        \item Test method: two-sample t-test % to determine whether the difference between means found in the sample is significantly different from the hypothesized difference between two means
        \item Significance level: 0.05
        \item Hypotheses entail one-tailed tests. Null hypothesis will be rejected if the mean difference between sample means is too small.

\begin{frame}{Experiments: Question 1 (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the relation between the amount of requests that RoboPizza receives and the waiting time for customers?
        \begin{itemize}
                \item $H_1$: The waiting time increases with the amount of requests.
                \item $H_0$: The waiting time does \textbf{not} increase with the amount of requests.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do robots drive more (non-idle time) when there are more requests in the system?
        \begin{itemize}
                \item $H_1$: Robots drive more when there are more requests in the system.
                \item $H_0$: Robots do \textbf{not} driving more when there are more requests in the system.

\begin{frame}{Experiments: Question 3 (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Does increasing the amount of robots decrease customer waiting time when there are many requests?
        \begin{itemize}
                \item $H_1$: Increasing the amount of robots decreases customer waiting time when there are many requests.
                \item $H_0$: Increasing the amount of robots does \textbf{not} decrease customer waiting time when there are many requests.
