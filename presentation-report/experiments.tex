\section{Experiments}

\begin{frame}{Experiments}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different parameter settings for each hypothesis
        \item Each experiment's final statistics are written to a file
        \item Samples are made of X experiment runs for each parameter setting
        \item Test method: two-sample t-test % to determine whether the difference between means found in the sample is significantly different from the hypothesized difference between two means
        \item Significance level: 0.05
        \item Hypotheses entail one-tailed tests. Null hypothesis will be rejected if the mean difference between sample means is too small.
