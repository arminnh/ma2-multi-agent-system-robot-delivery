1. Ask tasks from pizzeria (only when you're at pizzeria) (OK)
2. Send desire ants to each task (OK)
3. Desire ant comes back with delivery task ID, score, pizzas needed (OK, maybe change score)
4. Choose desire in order (OK)
5. Figure out amount of pizzas that the robot can send
6. Exploration + Confirmation of pizzaAmount (Give ant PizzaAmount)
=> Exploration will figure out which routes we can take
    1. DeliveryTask will confirm if it's possible to deliver this pizza amount
    => If we have multiple tasks in an ant we need to ask all these deliverytasks if we can make the delivery
    => Give exploration ant list of pairs <Destination, # pizzas>

7. Intention
8. Create pizzaParcel



- Remember reservations (DeliveryTasks -> List<DeliveryTaskData>)
